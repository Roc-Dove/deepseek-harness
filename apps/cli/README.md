# `@deepseek-ai/dsh`

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The `dsh` command is the product launcher for profiles: ordered stacks of plugin-bundle patch layers under the user's own overrides. [`src/args.ts`](src/args.ts) owns the command grammar, and [`src/bin.ts`](src/bin.ts) loads only the selected runner. Invalid commands, options from another mode, configuration errors, and boot failures exit nonzero.

## Entry modes

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dsh --profile <name>` | Boot the named profile under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>`. |
| `dsh --profile headless "job"` | Run one fresh persisted session, print the final answer, and exit. |
| `dsh web` | Alias of `--profile web`. |
| `dsh plugin --profile <name> <pnpm args>` | Manage a profile's plugins by forwarding to pnpm in the profile directory. |

The invoking directory is the default workspace root. The `web` and `headless` profiles auto-initialize on first use from shipped templates; any other profile must be created through `dsh plugin`.

## App arguments

The launcher parses only its own flags and hands everything after them to the booted profile, where any injected app plugin may parse the shared immutable snapshot ([`dsh-cmdline`](../../packages/boot/cmdline/README.md)). Launcher flags therefore come first, and the first token the launcher does not recognize starts the app's arguments:

```sh
dsh --profile web --port 8080       # --port belongs to the web app
dsh --profile tui --resume <id>     # example, assuming the tui profile is installed; --resume belongs to the terminal app
dsh --profile headless "run the tests"
dsh --profile web --help            # the web app's flags, not the launcher's
dsh --help                          # the launcher's own help
```

## Profiles

A profile directory holds a `package.json` (out-of-tree plugin dependencies plus the profile manifest `dsh.profile` with its ordered `bundles` list) and a `cordis.patch.yml` (the user's own patch layer).

The tree composes over an empty root:
- each bundle's patch in `dsh.profile.bundles` order
- then the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, then the home-level `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`
- then `--patch` overlays

Bundles named in `dsh.profile.bundles` resolve from the dsh installation first (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless`), then from the profile's own `node_modules`, where pnpm installs out-of-tree plugins.

Use `--dump-default-config` and `--dump-config` to inspect the composed tree without booting it.

The [CLI behavior reference](reference/README.md) owns exact layer precedence, flags, shutdown behavior, deployment defaults, and source execution.

## Shipped computer-use preset

The package ships `config/agent-presets/computer-use`, so `dsh web` presents **Computer use (macOS)** without copying a developer's local `DSH_HOME`. It is the Standard mode composition plus a reviewed MCP connection to a separately installed `/Applications/KimiCU.app`; KimiCU itself is not part of this package. The KimiCU 0.5.8 build verified for this integration is arm64-only and requires an Apple silicon Mac running macOS 14 or later, Screen Recording access, and Accessibility access. This repository does not redistribute KimiCU or provide a general download mirror.

If KimiCU is missing, the preset stays available with Standard mode tools and no `mcp__kimi-cu__*` tools. Under an interactive approval policy, each registered KimiCU MCP call asks before dispatch; a policy that resolves approvals as `never` rejects it. That requirement protects only calls routed through the registered MCP tools. It is not a sandbox around KimiCU or the preset's Standard mode shell. Screen and accessibility results may be sent to the selected model provider and persisted in session history. The default DeepSeek route can use accessibility text but cannot visually inspect screenshot pixels; image understanding requires an image-capable route. See the [Desktop guide](../desktop/README.md#computer-use-with-kimicu-on-macos) for the full platform, permission, data-flow, and recovery boundary.

## Development

Production runs require built package and frontend artifacts. From the repository root, run `pnpm run build` separately, then use `pnpm dsh <args...>` to run the TypeScript entry and forward every argument; the [source-execution reference](reference/README.md#source-execution) owns the module-resolution contract.
